# Verification Commands for Vite Upgrade

This document records the commands used to verify the successful installation and building of packages after the Vite upgrade from 5.4.8 to 5.4.19.

## Virtual Environment Setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r app/backend/requirements.txt
```

## Frontend Package Installation and Build Verification

```bash
cd app/frontend

# Clean install from scratch
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# Verify build works
npm run build

# Verify development server starts
npm run dev

# Check package versions
npm list vite esbuild

# Security audit
npm audit
```

## Full Stack Verification

```bash
# From repository root
cd app/frontend
npm install
npm run build

# Verify static files are generated correctly
ls -la app/backend/static/

# Backend dependencies (Python)
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r app/backend/requirements.txt
```

## Key Results

- **Vite Version**: Successfully upgraded from 5.4.8 to 5.4.19
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Reduced from 6 to 2 moderate vulnerabilities (remaining are dev-only esbuild issues)
- **Build Status**: ✅ All builds pass successfully
- **Development Server**: ✅ Starts correctly with CORS configuration
- **Production Build**: ✅ Generates static files correctly
- **Compatibility**: ✅ No breaking changes for the application

## Notes

The remaining 2 moderate vulnerabilities are related to esbuild in the development environment only and would require upgrading to Vite 7.x to resolve, which would be a breaking change beyond the scope of this fix.
